The enrollment team is gathering analytics about student enrollment throughout the years. Write a query 
that lists the total # of students that were enrolled in classes during each school year.  
The first column should have the header “Students?.  Provide a second “Year? column showing the enrollment year.

SELECT count(distinct studentId) AS 'Students',
YEAR(startDate) as 'Year'
FROM studentCourse
GROUP BY YEAR
ORDER BY YEAR, Students DESC;
