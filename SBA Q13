/*        4I
Students are awarded two grades based on the minimum and maximum progress they are making in the courses.  
The grading scale is as follows:
   Progress < 40:          F
  Progress < 50:         D
 Progress < 60:                C
        Progress < 70:               B
       Progress >= 70:             A
Write a query which displays each studentâ€™s first name, lastname, grade based on minimum progress, and grade based on maximum progress.
