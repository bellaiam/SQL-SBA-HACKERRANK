Using the above, write a query to list the course names and the # of students in those courses for all
courses where there are no assigned faculty.  The output should be ordered first by # of students 
descending and then by course name ascending.


//CODE

SELECT course.name, count(studentCourse.studentId)
FROM course
JOIN studentCourse
ON (course.id = studentCourse.courseId)
WHERE course.id NOT IN (SELECT courseId FROM facultyCourse)
GROUP BY course.name
ORDER BY count(studentCourse.studentId) DESC, course.name ASC;
