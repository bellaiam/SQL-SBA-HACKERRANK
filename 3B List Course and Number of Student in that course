The recruiting department needs to know which courses are most popular with the students.  
Please provide them with a query which lists each course and the number of students in that course.  
The two columns should have headers “Course Name? and “# Students?, and the output should be sorted 
by # Students descending and then by course name ascending.

// CODE
SELECT course.name, count(studentCourse.courseID)
FROM course
JOIN studentCourse
ON (course.id = studentCourse.courseId)
GROUP BY course.name
ORDER BY count(studentCourse.courseID) DESC, course.name ASC;
