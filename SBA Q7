The enrollment team is gathering analytics about student enrollment and they now want to know about August 
admissions specifically. Write a query that lists the Start Date and # of Students who enrolled in classes 
in August of each year. Output should be ordered by start date ascending.

//CODE

SELECT startDate, count(distinct studentId) 
FROM studentCourse
WHERE MONTH(startdate) ='08'
GROUP BY startdate
ORDER BY startdate, count(studentId);
