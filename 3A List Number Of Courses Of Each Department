The Curriculum Planning Committee is attempting to fill in gaps in the current course offerings.  
You need to provide them with a query which lists each department and the number of courses offered by that department.  
The two columns should have headers “Department Name? and “# Courses?, and the output should be sorted by the "# Courses" 
in each department (ascending).

//CODE

SELECT department.name, count(course.name)
FROM department
JOIN course
ON (department.id = course.deptid)
GROUP BY department.name
ORDER BY count(course.name);
